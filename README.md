Trivia Game
===========

This is a Disney related trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, a congratulation screen will be shown. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed - without any user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
If the player runs out of time or chooses the wrong answer, the correct answer will be shown. After 5 seconds, display is changed to the next question.

On the final screen, player will see the number of correct and incorrect answers and the number of unanswered ones. After that player has an option to restart the game by pressing the button (without reloading the page).
